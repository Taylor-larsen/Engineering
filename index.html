<p><b>Week 2:</b> <br> This week we started to learn about mechanical engineering. We looked at <br> the different Types of engineering and some jobs that go with mechanical engineering. On friday we did a challenge where we had to create an object on tinker cad. I made a calculator and I am really proud of it!</p>

<p><b>Week 3:</b>  <br>This week we continued to work on our tinker cad for our Rube Goldberg projects 
We need to make an almost exact replica of what we are going to later build.  This means making sure 
measurements are corret and everything is to scale.  This took up most of our class time and was a very tedious project.
 This week we also made sure that everyone's websites were working and accessable. 
My website never had any problems and everyhting was able to work smoohtly.</p>

<p><b>Week 4:</b> <br>This week we started to build our Rube Goldberg projects, we are building these projects in a groupd of four. 
we had to pick a tinker cad from our group to build.  Our group choose to build my design.  
When building this machine we ran into some problems inclulding things such as 
our pillars not being strong enough, poorly cut peices, and general design flaws. 
We were able to make changes to the design and build a structure that will be strong enough to support the whole machine. We also made our deisgn smaller and 
cut out peices so that it will be more efficient and work more smoohtly. 
On friday we did a challenge where we had to make a boat out of a sheet of paper 
and make is flout with wieghts.  My groups boat sunk immediately which was honestly not 
surprising.</p>

<p><b>Week 5:</b>  <br>This week we finished working on our Rube Goldberg projects.  Our <br>
original plan was to hold the baseball and then drop it to activate the machine. <br>
Then we realised that we needed to have a hands off start, so we had to make some <br>
changes to the machine.  We made a platform that would hold the ball up with out <br>
having the ruler raise, then when we removed a string holding up the platform the <br> 
ball would drop, releasing the ball and activating the machine.  This system worked <br>
really well.  In the second half of class on wednesday we tested out project.  <br>
My groups machine worked the first try.  Other groups are testing on friday, and it <br>
is really cool to see what everyone came up with.</p>

<p><b>Week 6:</b>  <br>This week I was absent pretty much all week so I didnt get to do much 
in engineering class.  I was there on friday, so in class on friday we finished disecting
a computer and then put the computer back together.  Putting the computer back together 
was pretty simple, we followed the inscruction but we did hit a problem.  WE did not 
know which screws went where, and we figured thsi out after we finished putting the  
computer together ebcuase there were bumps in the frame.  We went back in and fixed 
it as best we could.  It was really cool to see the insides of a computer.</p>

<p><b>Week 7:</b>  <br>This week we learned about Bioengineering.  On Monday we learned what Bioengineering is
and what types of jobs are in the bioengineering feild.  There are really cool jobs such as building prosthetics
for poeple who have lost limbs.  We also learned that bioengineers can work in the medical feild for the medical 
devices.  On wednesday we looked at prosthetics sepcifically for animals.  We picked an animal and what they were missing
and then we were supposed to design a prosthetic on tinker cad for that animal.  We had to be specific in 
what materials it was made of and if those materials were animal safe.  We also had tho think 
about how it would attatch to the animal.  Lastly, on friday we did a challenge where we had to 
create a set of instructions for how to make a PB+J sandwich.  I learned that we had to be 
very specific in what out directions said and that you have to assume that the person/machine
following your instructions does not know what they are doing.  I though my instructions were pretty good
but they were missing important parts such as opening the bag of bread.</p>

<P><b>Week 8:</b> <br>This week we learned about areospace engineeing.  On monday we were able to have
a real areospace engineer talk to us about the feild.  It was really interesting and the feild
has some incredible parts to it.  Then on wednesday we started to design our own rocket/airplane.
We had to make our designs on tinker cad and to size. I decided to deisn an airplane so that it would
be able to fly far.  The airplane is for a competition where we see what groups rocket/plane goes the 
furthest.  Then on friday we did a challenge where we made paper airplanes and tried to get 
then as close as we could to a target.  We threw them off the 2nd story building.  My airplane went
far but just not in the right direction.</P>

<p><b>Week 9:</b> <br> This week we worked on building the designs we made on tinker cad last week.  
We picked one design to build from our group, we picked tristans design.  On monday we started to 
build our designs.  One cool part of our design was that we had the idea to use fans on 
our plane to propel it.  On wednesday we continued to work on building our plane, and it looked 
super cool.  Lastly, on friday we tested our designs. Our plane did not work, it fell on the ground
right after it got launched.  We wanted to then do it again but one of the wings fell off. </p>

<p><b>Week 10:</b> <br> This week we learned about enviromental engineering.  Enviromental
engineering is all about cleaning up the messes that humanity makes.  In Enviromental 
Engineering you focus on trying to help global warming and overall help the envirment.
For example, one focus of this engineering is water filtration.  We learned about the process
in which water is filtered and cleaned so that it could be reused in water sources
or in homes.  Then on Thursday we did two challenges, one was a candy corn challenge where we had to tru
and figure out how many candy corn could fit on a piece of paper but we onlky had 10 candy corn.  My group was somewhat close
but we didn't get super close.  Then we made a water filter.  Our Supplies were a bottle, big rocks,
little rocks, sand, and tissues.  My groups water filter worked very well and made the water
pretty clean.</p>

<p><b>Week 11:</b> <br>This week we started to learn about electrical engineering.  We learned about
how circuts worked and different types of circuts.  I learned that two types of circuts
are series and parallel.  We also learned about different components to a circut, some of these 
are diodes, resisters, and power supplies.  We also leanred how to calculate the voltage, amps, and resistance.  
Then on friday we worked on making circuts in tinkercad.  We made both a series and a parallel circut.

<p><b>Week: 12</b> <br> This week we did more on electrical engineering. On Tuesday we built circuts.  We had 
a breadboard, multimeter, resisters, leds, and everything else you need.  We built several different circuts,
we made both a prarllel and series circut like how we did in tinker cad.  We looked at the differnt colors of LEDS and
what each color means and how it affects the circut.  One thing I learend was that in a series circut, with the voltage we were using
you had to use all red LEDs otherwise non of them will light up.  Then on Thursday we did a challenge where we 
had to decide if we would rather count to a million or sit in a math class for a year to get an "A".  I choose to sit in 
a math class because you have to take math as a class anyways so it wouldn't really cahnge anything.  </p>

<p><b>Week: 13</b> <br>
This week we finished electrical engineering.  We worked on arduino progromming
and using that software to program our arduino.  We made different patterns in a parallel circut 
like the lights flashing at differnt times.  The programming was very straight forward
but you could make very cool patterns like the loading loop.  Then on friday we did a challengew
the class was split in two and one team was team wheels and the other was team doors.  
We had to debate wether there were more doors or wheel on campus.  I was team doors, we had
15 minutes to run around the school and count as many doors as we could.  My team
said that books were a bunch of doors that did not include wheels so we were able to win.  We
also had a stronger argument and an actual number.</p>

<p><b>Week 14:</b> <br>
This week we learned about civil engineering.  Civil Engineering is the building of infastructure 
and specifically bridges.  Then on Wenesday we started working on our final project.
Our final project is to build a bridge out of 20 pieces of sphagetti and wood glue.  The 
Goal is to make a bridge that will support the weight of a bucket with added water, we aretrying to make 
the most efficient bridge.  Over the corse of the weeks leading up to finals we have 100 pieces of 
sphagetti and we are to make prototypes and see what bridges work the best.</p>

<h1>Semester 2</h1>

<p><b>Week 1:</b>  <br>
This week we worked on management engineering.  We looked at how companies come up with ideas
and pitch them.  We also learned how companies may be managed.  For our project this week we had to do 
a shark tank presentation.  We were in groups and had to come up with a product to sell and pitch it to the class, 
we needed to include what the cost and stakes were.  My group was Theo and Aaron, we came up with the idea of "sloth"
an anti-energy drink.  It is a drink that helped you fall asleep instead of giving you energy.  Our pitch went very well
and overall we had a solid idea that had good info backing it up.</p>
