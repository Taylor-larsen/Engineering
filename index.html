<p><b>Week 2:</b> <br> This week we started to learn about mechanical engineering. We looked at <br> the different Types of engineering and some jobs that go with mechanical engineering. On friday we did a challenge where we had to create an object on tinker cad. I made a calculator and I am really proud of it!</p>

<p><b>Week 3:</b>  <br>This week we continued to work on our tinker cad for our Rube Goldberg projects 
We need to make an almost exact replica of what we are going to later build.  This means making sure 
measurements are corret and everything is to scale.  This took up most of our class time and was a very tedious project.
 This week we also made sure that everyone's websites were working and accessable. 
My website never had any problems and everyhting was able to work smoohtly.</p>

<p><b>Week 4:</b> <br>This week we started to build our Rube Goldberg projects, we are building these projects in a groupd of four. 
we had to pick a tinker cad from our group to build.  Our group choose to build my design.  
When building this machine we ran into some problems inclulding things such as 
our pillars not being strong enough, poorly cut peices, and general design flaws. 
We were able to make changes to the design and build a structure that will be strong enough to support the whole machine. We also made our deisgn smaller and 
cut out peices so that it will be more efficient and work more smoohtly. 
On friday we did a challenge where we had to make a boat out of a sheet of paper 
and make is flout with wieghts.  My groups boat sunk immediately which was honestly not 
surprising.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Week 5:</b>  <br>This week we finished working on our Rube Goldberg projects.  Our <br>
original plan was to hold the baseball and then drop it to activate the machine. <br>
Then we realised that we needed to have a hands off start, so we had to make some <br>
changes to the machine.  We made a platform that would hold the ball up with out <br>
having the ruler raise, then when we removed a string holding up the platform the <br> 
ball would drop, releasing the ball and activating the machine.  This system worked <br>
really well.  In the second half of class on wednesday we tested out project.  <br>
My groups machine worked the first try.  Other groups are testing on friday, and it <br>
is really cool to see what everyone came up with.</p>

<p><b>Week 6:</b>  <br>This week I was absent pretty much all week so I didnt get to do much 
in engineering class.  I was there on friday, so in class on friday we finished disecting
a computer and then put the computer back together.  Putting the computer back together 
was pretty simple, we followed the inscruction but we did hit a problem.  WE did not 
know which screws went where, and we figured thsi out after we finished putting the  
computer together ebcuase there were bumps in the frame.  We went back in and fixed 
it as best we could.  It was really cool to see the insides of a computer.</p>

<p><b>Week 7:</b>  <br>This week we learned about Bioengineering.  On Monday we learned what Bioengineering is
and what types of jobs are in the bioengineering feild.  There are really cool jobs such as building prosthetics
for poeple who have lost limbs.  We also learned that bioengineers can work in the medical feild for the medical 
devices.  On wednesday we looked at prosthetics sepcifically for animals.  We picked an animal and what they were missing
and then we were supposed to design a prosthetic on tinker cad for that animal.  We had to be specific in 
what materials it was made of and if those materials were animal safe.  We also had tho think 
about how it would attatch to the animal.  Lastly, on friday we did a challenge where we had to 
create a set of instructions for how to make a PB+J sandwich.  I learned that we had to be 
very specific in what out directions said and that you have to assume that the person/machine
following your instructions does not know what they are doing.  I though my instructions were pretty good
but they were missing important parts such as opening the bag of bread.</p>

<P><b>Week 8:</b> <br>This week we learned about areospace engineeing.  On monday we were able to have
a real areospace engineer talk to us about the feild.  It was really interesting and the feild
has some incredible parts to it.  Then on wednesday we started to design our own rocket/airplane.
We had to make our designs on tinker cad and to size. I decided to deisn an airplane so that it would
be able to fly far.  The airplane is for a competition where we see what groups rocket/plane goes the 
furthest.  Then on friday we did a challenge where we made paper airplanes and tried to get 
then as close as we could to a target.  We threw them off the 2nd story building.  My airplane went
far but just not in the right direction.</P>

<p><b>Week 9:</b> <br> This week we worked on building the designs we made on tinker cad last week.  
We picked one design to build from our group, we picked tristans design.  On monday we started to 
build our designs.  One cool part of our design was that we had the idea to use fans on 
our plane to propel it.  On wednesday we continued to work on building our plane, and it looked 
super cool.  Lastly, on friday we tested our designs. Our plane did not work, it fell on the ground
right after it got launched.  We wanted to then do it again but one of the wings fell off. </p>

<p><b>Week 10:</b> <br> This week we learned about enviromental engineering.  Enviromental
engineering is all about cleaning up the messes that humanity makes.  In Enviromental 
Engineering you focus on trying to help global warming and overall help the envirment.
For example, one focus of this engineering is water filtration.  We learned about the process
in which water is filtered and cleaned so that it could be reused in water sources
or in homes.  Then on Thursday we did two challenges, one was a candy corn challenge where we had to tru
and figure out how many candy corn could fit on a piece of paper but we onlky had 10 candy corn.  My group was somewhat close
but we didn't get super close.  Then we made a water filter.  Our Supplies were a bottle, big rocks,
little rocks, sand, and tissues.  My groups water filter worked very well and made the water
pretty clean.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Week 11:</b> <br>This week we started to learn about electrical engineering.  We learned about
how circuts worked and different types of circuts.  I learned that two types of circuts
are series and parallel.  We also learned about different components to a circut, some of these 
are diodes, resisters, and power supplies.  We also leanred how to calculate the voltage, amps, and resistance.  
Then on friday we worked on making circuts in tinkercad.  We made both a series and a parallel circut.
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Week: 12</b> <br> This week we did more on electrical engineering. On Tuesday we built circuts.  We had 
a breadboard, multimeter, resisters, leds, and everything else you need.  We built several different circuts,
we made both a prarllel and series circut like how we did in tinker cad.  We looked at the differnt colors of LEDS and
what each color means and how it affects the circut.  One thing I learend was that in a series circut, with the voltage we were using
you had to use all red LEDs otherwise non of them will light up.  Then on Thursday we did a challenge where we 
had to decide if we would rather count to a million or sit in a math class for a year to get an "A".  I choose to sit in 
a math class because you have to take math as a class anyways so it wouldn't really cahnge anything.  </p>

<p><b>Week: 13</b> <br>
This week we finished electrical engineering.  We worked on arduino progromming
and using that software to program our arduino.  We made different patterns in a parallel circut 
like the lights flashing at differnt times.  The programming was very straight forward
but you could make very cool patterns like the loading loop.  Then on friday we did a challengew
the class was split in two and one team was team wheels and the other was team doors.  
We had to debate wether there were more doors or wheel on campus.  I was team doors, we had
15 minutes to run around the school and count as many doors as we could.  My team
said that books were a bunch of doors that did not include wheels so we were able to win.  We
also had a stronger argument and an actual number.</p>

<p><b>Week 14:</b> <br>
This week we learned about civil engineering.  Civil Engineering is the building of infastructure 
and specifically bridges.  Then on Wenesday we started working on our final project.
Our final project is to build a bridge out of 20 pieces of sphagetti and wood glue.  The 
Goal is to make a bridge that will support the weight of a bucket with added water, we aretrying to make 
the most efficient bridge.  Over the corse of the weeks leading up to finals we have 100 pieces of 
sphagetti and we are to make prototypes and see what bridges work the best.</p>

<h1>Semester 2</h1>

<p><b>Week 1:</b>  <br>
This week we worked on management engineering.  We looked at how companies come up with ideas
and pitch them.  We also learned how companies may be managed.  For our project this week we had to do 
a shark tank presentation.  We were in groups and had to come up with a product to sell and pitch it to the class, 
we needed to include what the cost and stakes were.  My group was Theo and Aaron, we came up with the idea of "sloth"
an anti-energy drink.  It is a drink that helped you fall asleep instead of giving you energy.  Our pitch went very well
and overall we had a solid idea that had good info backing it up.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Week 2:</b>  <br>
This week we learned about chemical engineering.  On wednesday we talked about some of the branches of 
Chemical engineering.  Some of them are fuel, nuclear, nanotechnology, and molecular.  The things that chemical engineers
are able to do is really cool.  Then, we had to solve a problem of a lake with to much chlorine, sunlight, and bromide.  
My group came up with reverse osmosis but the actual answer was to put little black balls in the
lake to block out sunlight.  On friday we made oobleck which is made of cornstartch and water. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>Week 3:</b> <br>
This week we started out several week long project.  We did our project proposal and
my group chose to make a mouse trap car.  My group is Theo and Aaron, we were able write our project proposal
with deadlines and a detailed description of the project.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Week 4:</b> <br>
This week we worked on making our CAD designs for the mousetrap car.  We made suer that all of our 
measurements were correct and were what we were actaully going to put on our design.  
</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Mouse trap car (6 weeks)</b>  <br>
       The past six weeks we have been working on a mouse trap car.  My group is Theo and Aaron. 
       Our design was a three wheeled car with two wheels in the front and one in the back.  Throughout the six
       weeks we encountered many challenges and problems that impacted our cars function.  But eventaully 
       we were able to make a decent car.  Our car ended up going 75% of the way across the cafeteria and 
       taking into account how poorly it had performed in testing this was very good.
           
           
           One of the main stuggles we encountered was with our back wheel.  This wheel in the beginning was very
           wobbly and hindered the cars ability.  we tried to fix this by adding straws for support and this helped a little 
           bit, but we realized that the way the wheel turned was not right.  We then had to entirely change the was the wheel spun.
           But this made the string from the mousetrap run against the wheel, stopping its movement forward.  Eventually we
           were able to make the wheels work well and the car was able to perfrom pretty well.
           
           
           This project was very fun and my group learned a lot.  It was very interesting to learn about how the mousetrap
           cars work.  We learned about the physics of the mousetrap pulling the car into a forward motion and
           how forces such as friction act on a car.  We also saw that when the wheels do not spin straight the 
           forward motion of the car is impoacted.  We had to work alot on getting the wheel straight. Overall this
           project.</p>
           <hr>
           <p><b>Week 9:</b> <br>
           </p>This week we did a gutter boat challenge.  At first I was really confused on how we were supposed
           to make a boat out of the materials we were given. We had to make sure that we stayed within the size restraints and 
           also provide propoltion for out boat.  The boat did pretty well, we were able to make it go about 7ft.  Although 
           our propoltion idea did not work at all.  I would improve this by taking off all the excess stuff we had
           on the boat and also I would have come up with a different way to power the boat becuase out first way did not work.  Luckily we did 
           have a backup sail.
           
           <p><b>Week 10:</b>  <br>
           This week we started our next project.  This project is an egg drop challenge.  We have a certian amount of materials to use 
           and have to create something that will keep an egg from cracking when dropped off a 3 story building.  On Wednesday we came up with our
           design ideas and had to figure out what and how much of materials we needed.  Then, on Firday we took our group design and had to put it into tinker cad.
           This was difficult because its hard to make sure that all the dimensions were correct and hwat we are actually going to build.
    </p>    <hr> 
    <p><b>Week 11:</b>  <br>
    This week we were building our egg drop contraptions.  We used the tinker CAD design we made to make sure we build the right dimensions.  We were working on building our 
    design all week and then on thursday we dropped our designs.  Our design had a parachute and it worked very well, we dropped it and the egg did not break.  But then we wanted to try 
    and drop it without the parachute and the egg cracked.  But overall our project worked really well.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Week: 12</b>  <br>
    This week we started our next big project.  This project is to build a cardboard boat that will fit 2 people and will travel across our pool.  We have a long time build this boat but we can only
    use cardboard and duct tape.  My group is Aaron, Theo and me and we decided that me and Theo are going to go into the boat.  We each deisgned our own boat and I made mine look like a canoe, then we 
    all worked together to come up with a group design and it is like a canoe again but bigger than my original design. Then later in the week we worked together on making a thinker CAD of our
    boat with the exact dimensions we will need. </p>
    
    <hr>
    <p><b>Week: 13</b>  <br>
    This week we started to build our boats.  On Monday we worked on updating our websites because on Monday there is not much time to actually do stuff.  But on Wednesday we started to cut out our boats from the carboard
    we have.  That day we were able to get our paddles cut out. We cut them out the first time but realised that they would not work very well so we recut them.  Then, on Friday we started to cut out the boat itself.  We adjusted some of the 
    mesurements because we thought that out boat should be longer to make sure it can support all of our weight.  We were able to cut out the Bottom pieces, the back and the beginning of the front.  We had to stop working because we used all of the carboard
    we were allowed to used for the day.  We have not been able to tape anything yet becuase the tap hasn't come yet, but we were able to get a lot of things done.  This week was very prodcutive and I think our boat will work well.</p>
    
<hr>
<p><b>Week 14:</b>   <br> 
This week we continued on building our carboard boats.  On Tuesday we cut out the two sides of our boat, we cut them in two segments each because the cardboard was not long enough.  That day we also worked on cutting out more of the front
of our boat because that comes in multiple pieces.  Then, on Thursday in the beginnning of class we worked on getting our websites up and running so that they could be presentable for Open House.  After we worked on the websites for a little bit we started to build a prototype of our boat
  that we could test in the pool.  Our prototype was 1/3 the actual size and we were able to build it fairly quickly and easily.  When we tested it, the boat was able to hold 4 bricks and could have held more but that was all we had.  It started leaking from the spots that didn't have 
  enough tape to fully seal the edges efectively.  The boat could have held a lot more and the boat only dropped about an inch in the water.  My group is very hopeful that we will be able to build a 
  boat that should work.</p>

  <p><b>Week 15:</b>. <br>
  This week we got small amounts of tape that we could use to start putting our boats together.  We were able to quickly line up our peices because we had labeled everything and started to use small amounts of tape to get our boat to stick together.
  The baot is plenty big and we think that it will be able to easily hold our weight, the only issue is that since the boat is very large we are worried about the boat not being very stable.  The sides tend to bend inwards so we are going to build supports to keep the water from
  pushing in the sides to much.  We also retested our prototype for fun because half the class hadn't tested their prototypes so we went down to the pool with everyone.  Next week we are going to get our own tape and we will be able to finish our boat.</p>

  <p><b>Week 16:</b>  <br>
  This week we got our groups tape, we finished waterproofing our boat and our boat is almost done.  We used most of our tape to line the bottom of the boat to keep the cardboard from getting wet and that finished basically all of our tape.  Then on Friday we made a few adjustments to the baot and then pretty much just sat there and drew on the boat.
  But, we did come up with ways we can stavilyze the boat without the use of our tape.  Next week we are going to have to finish stabilizing the boat and make our last paddle.  This week we remade our paddles because we realised that 
  our paddles were not very good.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><b>Week 17:</b>  <br>
  This week we were continuing on working on our boat.  Our group did not have very much to do because we practically finished the boat.  We decided that we were going to double line the entire boat with cardboard.  We grabbed 
  more cardboard and put another floor in each of the compartments and made more sides.  We also wanted to line the boat with more cardboard to cover up all the weird drawings we did in the boat because it was making the boat look really ugly.  On friday we 
  did a challenge.  For this challenge we were to make a paper rollercaoster for a marble, this rollercaoster had to be decent in length and have at least two loops.  We were able to make this pretty easily but the loops took a lot of time to get right.</p>

  <p><b>Week 18:</b>  <br>
  This week we used the very last of our tape to secure the 2nd layer of carboard on to the boat and to make out last paddle.
  The rest of this week we worked on our rollercoaster.  We added much more to the rollercoaster inclduing a funnel and a small jump.  The rollercoaster got much taller and we needed to use
  a lot of tape to get it to continue to stand.  We needed to build a lot of supports because of how tall it was.  But when we tested it, the rollercoaster worked very well.  One thing about the rollercoaster tho was
  that it takes a lot of time to get right and that was hard trying to fix the tiny things to get the marble to roll through.</p>
