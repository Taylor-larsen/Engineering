<p>This week we started to learn about mechanical engineering. We looked at <br> the different Types of engineering and some jobs that go with mechanical engineering. <br> On friday we did a challenge where we had to create an object on tinker cad.  <br>  I made a calculator and I am really proud of it!</p>
