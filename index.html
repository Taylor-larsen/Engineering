<p>Week:2 This week we started to learn about mechanical engineering. We looked at <br> the different Types of engineering and some jobs that go with mechanical engineering. <br> On friday we did a challenge where we had to create an object on tinker cad.  <br>  I made a calculator and I am really proud of it!</p>

<p>Week 3:  This week we continued to work on our tinker cad for our Rube Goldberg proect <br>
We need to make an almost exact replica of what we are going to later build.  This means <br>  making sure 
measurements are corret and everything is to scale.  This took up most of our class time and was a very tedious project.
<br> This week we also made sure that everyone's websites were working and accessable. <br>
My website never had any problems and everyhting was able to work smoohtly.</p>

<p>Week 4: This week we started to build our Rube Goldberg projects, we are building these projects in a groupd of four. <br>
we had to pick a tinker cad from our group to build.  Our group choose to build my design.  <br>
When building this machine we ran into some problems inclulding things such as <br>
our pillars not being strong enough, poorly cut peices, and general design flaws. <br>
We were able to make changes to the design and build a structure that will be strong enough to support the whole machine. We also made our deisgn smaller and <br>
cut out peices so that it will be more efficient and work more smoohtly. <br>
On friday we did a challenge where we had to make a boat out of a sheet of paper <br>
and make is flout with wieghts.  My groups boat sunk immediately which was honestly not <br>
surprising.</p>
